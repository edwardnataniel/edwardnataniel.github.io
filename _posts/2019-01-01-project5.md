## Overview

**GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC)** is a recombination-associated process where **G/C alleles are favored over A/T alleles**. The non-symmetric segregation of G/C and A/T is a result of the mismatch repair bias that occurs during **meiosis**, producing more G/C than A/T-containing gametes. This mimics positive selection by promoting the fixation of G/C over A/T, thereby having implications on studies on functional genomics and evolution. However, despite the existence of evidence indicating the presence of gBGC in mammals, and its effect on evolution, **there is still no direct classical statistical test of gBGC on humans**. This paper aims **to test the hypothesis of GC-biased gene conversion in the highly recombining regions of human DNA**. Candidate hotspot regions were determined and CpG islands, gene, and gene-associated regions were eliminated. **Haplotype networks** were constructed for each of these regions; and recombination and gene conversion events were inferred from these networks. Statistical tests were performed on the inferred gene conversion mutations to test for the gBGC hypothesis. Results show that **there is a significant (p<0.05)  bias towards AT->GC mutations**.
