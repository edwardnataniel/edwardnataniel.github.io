## Overview
This research aims to build a model that explains a country’s **vulnerability** to extreme natural events using indicators related to disaster preparedness and management. The indicators used in this study are the following: exposure index, world giving index, education index, health expenditure, forest area, female population, gross domestic product per capita, population ages 15-64, institutions index, infrastructure index, goods market efficiency index, technological readiness index, and innovation index. Vulnerability was regressed using the aforementioned indicators. The final regression model has the remaining independent variables: world giving index, education index, gross domestic product per capita, infrastructure index, and population ages 15-64. The results of this study can be used as a guide to explain the dynamics of and to reduce a country’s vulnerability to extreme natural events

#### A more recent study about vulnerability that uses more independent variables and more observations can be found here: <u><a href="https://https://edwardnataniel.github.io/blog/project7/"> https://https://edwardnataniel.github.io/blog/project7/ </a></u>. This project uses principal component regression rather than simple linear regression due to handle the strong correlation among the independent variables.
