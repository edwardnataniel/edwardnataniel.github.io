## Overview
This research aims to build a parsimonious model that explains a countryâ€™s vulnerability to extreme natural events using socio-economic indicators such as GDP per capita, health expenditure per capita,  percentage of internet users, literacy rate, unemployment rate, etc.

Due to a high degree of association among the socio-economic indicators, **principal component analysis** was used to derive a new and smaller set of uncorrelated variables called **PCs (Principal Components)**. **Multiple linear regression** was run using the derived PCs as the independent variables and the vulnerability scores as the dependent variable.

Some countries are more exposed to certain natural hazards due to their geographical location. However, exposure, intensity, and duration of natural hazards alone will not determine its overall impact to a certain country or community. Some communities may be able to recover relatively quickly than others, while some may only have limited capabilities to cope with disasters. Exposure must be examined in conjunction with **vulnerability**, a multifaceted concept related to the societal factors and economic structures within a community that makes it susceptible to the negative impacts of natural hazards.

## Objectives of the Study 
1. To build the simplest possible intuitive model that will explain the vulnerability of a country to natural disasters using socio-economic indicators.

2. To build a linear regression model that is simple, and can easily be presented to communities in line with the efforts for disaster awareness and preparedness. 

## Methodology
#### Data
The data for this study were primarily obtained from the **World Bank Open Data** (https://data.worldbank.org). The percentages of the population living under the poverty line were obtained from the **2017 Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) World Factbook**. The vulnerability and exposure indices were obtained from the **2019 WorldRiskReport (WRR)**. The data per indicator were downloaded separately and then combined into a single dataset. Countries with missing values for a specific variable were excluded from the analysis. A total of **168 countries** were included in this study.

#### Dependent Variable
* **Vulnerability index (%) (VUL)** - This is the dependent variable. Vulnerability is calculated as the mean of susceptibility (S), lack of coping capacity (LCC), and lack of adaptive capacity (LAC). 

#### Independent Variables

* **Vulnerability index (%) (VUL)** - This is the dependent variable. Vulnerability is calculated as the mean of susceptibility (S), lack of coping capacity (LCC), and lack of adaptive capacity (LAC). 

* **Exposure (%) (EXPOSURE)** - Defined as the proportion of population exposed to natural disasters. 

* **Urban Population (URBAN_POP)** - Refers to people living in urban areas as defined by national statistical offices.

* **Mortality from CVD, cancer, diabetes or CRD between exact ages 30 and 70 (%) (MORTALITY_DISEASES)** - Refers to the percentage of 30-year-old people who would die before their 70th birthday from any of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease.

* **Population, female (%) (PERCENT_FEMALE)** - The percentage of the population that is female.

* **Population living under the Poverty Line (%) (POVERTY)** - The percentage of the population living under the poverty line. Definition of poverty line varies per country. 

* **Unemployment, total (%) (UNEMPLOYMENT)** - Refers to the share of the labor force that is without work but available for and seeking employment.

* **Literacy rate, adult total (%) (LITERACY)** -The percentage of people ages 15 and above who can both read and write with understanding a short simple statement about their everyday life.

* **School enrollment, tertiary (%) (TERTIARY_ENROLLMENT)** - Gross enrollment ratio is the ratio of total enrollment, regardless of age, to the population of the age group that officially corresponds to tertiary level.

* **GDP per capita (current US$) (GDPPC)** - The gross domestic product divided by midyear population.

* **Population ages 15-64 (%) (WORKING_AGE)** - Total population between the ages 15 to 64 as a percentage of the total population.

* **Current health expenditure per capita (current US$) (HEALTH_EXPENDITURE)** - Current expenditures on health per capita in current US dollars.

* **Individuals using the Internet (%) (INTERNET_ACCESS)** - Internet users are individuals who have used the Internet (from any location) in the last 3 months. The Internet can be used via a computer, mobile phone, personal digital assistant, games machine, digital TV etc.

* **People using at least basic drinking water services (% of population) (%) (WATER_ACCESS)** - The percentage of people using at least basic water services. This indicator encompasses both people using basic water services as well as those using safely managed water services.
