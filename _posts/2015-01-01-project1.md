### Abstract
We minimize flooding vulnerability for a city in the central plain of Luzon, by ‘rearranging’ the barangays (communities in the city) via a **genetic algorithm**. The different components of flooding vulnerability were investigated, and each was given a weight, which allows us to express vulnerability as a weighted sum. This serves as the fitness function for the genetic algorithm. We also allowed non-linear interactions among related but independent components, viz, poverty and mortality rate, and literacy and radio/ TV penetration. The designs produced reflect the relative importance of the components, and synchronicity between the interacting components is observed. 

### Background
All disaster management plans begin with the identification of risk (UN/ISDR, 2004), see [Lo, 2010]. **Risk** is an indicator of how prone a specific area is for a natural hazard to turn into a disaster; it is a function of three factors defined by this equation: 

**Risk = Hazard x Vulnerability x Exposure**

When natural hazards are concerned, little can be done on the hazard probability of a certain area for a specific disaster. We find exposure has the same problem. This is why **most disaster management plans focus on modifying the vulnerability index to minimize risk**. 

Because of its geographic location in both the Southeast Asian monsoon and typhoon belts, the ""Philippines"" is prone to flooding in various areas. One city that experience frequent flooding is the city of Urdaneta in Pangasinan. **The purpose of conducting a Scenario Analysis is to assess the threat of damage, liability, loss, or other negative occurrence caused by internal or external vulnerabilities in Urdaneta**.

## Genetic Algorithms

Copying natural evolution, i.e., inheritance, mutation, selection and crossover, **Genetic Algorithm** has gained wide acceptance in solving real-world engineering optimization problems (Kingston, 2011). GA is used because of this case’s high dimensionality. Adapting the concept of  dog and/or cattle breeding, the method takes champion males and females to breed, in the hope of producing desirable *traits* in the offspring. Here, a *champion* city has the desirable trait of a low vulnerability to flooding. We will define *chromosomes* for our *champion* cities, and the GA will then take care of *breeding* the cities, looking for the one with lowest vulnerability and cost. 

## Methodology

The physical property of each barangay in Urdaneta, Pangasinan was defined. The barangays lying on the flood plain nearest the river will have a factor of two (to double the vulnerability), and are marked with red numbers.  Less prone to flooding will have a value of 1 (will not affect vulnerability), shown in pink numbers, and even less prone will have a factor of ½, shown in white. These numbers will be used to multiply the area’s vulnerability.

Eleven chromosomes were identified. Each chromosome will be given a value from 0 to 3 per barangay based on the data from the government of Urdaneta, Pangasinan. (See full paper for the description of each chromosome). The 11 chromosomes are:  
1) Urbanized Area Ratio  
2) Literacy Rate  
3) Mortality Rate  
4) Population Under Poverty  
5) TV / Radio Penetration Rate  
6) State of Non-structural Measures  
7) State of Structural Measures  
8) Percentage of Population  
9) Percentage of Area / Extent  
10) Economic Value  
11) Cost of Relocation  

**Vulnerability** is assumed to be a weighted sum of the components:  
V<sub>i</sub> = S<sub>i</sub>* (W<sub>Urbanized</sub>\*X<sub>Urbanized</sub> + 
  W<sub>Literacy</sub>\*X<sub>Literacy</sub>\*W<sub>TvRadio</sub>\*X<sub>TvRadio</sub> + 
  W<sub>Mortality</sub>\*X<sub>Mortality</sub>\* W<sub>Poverty</sub>\*X<sub>Poverty</sub> +
   W<sub>Nonstructural</sub>\*X<sub>Nonstructural</sub> +
   W<sub>Structural</sub>\*X<sub>Structural</sub> + 
   W<sub>Population</sub>\*X<sub>Population</sub> + 
   W<sub>Extent</sub>\*X<sub>Extent</sub> + 
   W<sub>EconomicValue</sub>\*X<sub>EconomicValue</sub> + 
   W<sub>CostOfRelocation</sub>\*X<sub>CostOfRelocation</sub>)

  A **cost function** or **penalty function** is defined:  
  C<sub>i</sub> = exp(3 - X<sub>Urbanized</sub>) + (3 – X<sub>Literacy</sub>)  +  (3 - X<sub>Mortality</sub>)2  + exp(3 – X<sub>Poverty</sub>) + (3 – X<sub>TVRadio</sub>) + (3 – X<sub>Nonstructural</sub>) + exp(3 - X<sub>Structural</sub>) + (3 - X<sub>Population</sub>)+ exp(3 - X<sub>EconomicValue</sub>) +  exp (3 - X<sub>CostOfRelocation</sub>))/S<sub>i</sub>
  
  Finally, we determine the **weights** to be used in the vulnerability function. The table below comes from the State of Michigan, USA, Vulnerability Assessment Protocol, originally used for prioritizing hazards, which we now use _to prioritize the components of vulnerability_. We took only the first two columns, those under “always very important” and “usually important”. The weights were assigned objectively by the researchers.

The **GA** function in **MATLAB** was used to run the genetic algorithm. 

  ## Results and Conclusion

  The results we got from running GA in the toolbox produced the following ideal arrangements for the 16 barangays, broken-down by chromosomes. Below are the results for two selected chromosomes.

For the Mortality Rate: This is where resources could be placed. The recommendation is to improve mortality (health), particularly areas north, or closer to the river.

For Urbanization: The recommendation is to make/ keep areas in the north (near river) green. The recommendation extends south east, through the Poblacion (town center).

The scenario analysis revealed a 12% decrease in vulnerability with a corresponding one percent increase in cost. The cost/vulnerability ratio increased by about 15%.  

The analysis and specific recommendations for Urdaneta presented here could guide local government on allocation of resources, and the areas that can be improved on, with the aim of lowering flooding vulnerability. It could be adopted by national government for other cities, but it should be noted that analysis has to be local, that is, each area has to be studied, and its own vulnerability function calculated, to come up with appropriate recommendations.
