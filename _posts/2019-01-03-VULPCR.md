## Overview
This research aims to build a parsimonious model that explains a country’s vulnerability to extreme natural events using socio-economic indicators such as GDP per capita, health expenditure per capita,  percentage of internet users, literacy rate, unemployment rate, etc.

Due to a high degree of association among the socio-economic indicators, **principal component analysis** was used to derive a new and smaller set of uncorrelated variables called **PCs (Principal Components)**. **Multiple linear regression** was run using the derived PCs as the independent variables and the vulnerability scores as the dependent variable.

Some countries are more exposed to certain natural hazards due to their geographical location. However, exposure, intensity, and duration of natural hazards alone will not determine its overall impact to a certain country or community. Some communities may be able to recover relatively quickly than others, while some may only have limited capabilities to cope with disasters. Exposure must be examined in conjunction with **vulnerability**, a multifaceted concept related to the societal factors and economic structures within a community that makes it susceptible to the negative impacts of natural hazards.

## Objectives of the Study 
1. To build the simplest possible intuitive model that will explain the vulnerability of a country to natural disasters using socio-economic indicators.

2. To build a linear regression model that is simple, and can easily be presented to communities in line with the efforts for disaster awareness and preparedness. 

## Methodology
#### Data
The data for this study were primarily obtained from the **World Bank Open Data** (https://data.worldbank.org). The percentages of the population living under the poverty line were obtained from the **2017 Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) World Factbook**. The vulnerability and exposure indices were obtained from the **2019 WorldRiskReport (WRR)**. The data per indicator were downloaded separately and then combined into a single dataset. Countries with missing values for a specific variable were excluded from the analysis. A total of **168 countries** were included in this study. 

Here are the first 10 observations of the dataset:

#### Dependent Variable
* **Vulnerability index (%) (VUL)** - This is the dependent variable. Vulnerability is calculated as the mean of susceptibility (S), lack of coping capacity (LCC), and lack of adaptive capacity (LAC). 

#### Independent Variables

* **Vulnerability index (%) (VUL)** - This is the dependent variable. Vulnerability is calculated as the mean of susceptibility (S), lack of coping capacity (LCC), and lack of adaptive capacity (LAC). 

* **Exposure (%) (EXPOSURE)** - Defined as the proportion of population exposed to natural disasters. 

* **Urban Population (URBAN_POP)** - Refers to people living in urban areas as defined by national statistical offices.

* **Mortality from CVD, cancer, diabetes or CRD between exact ages 30 and 70 (%) (MORTALITY_DISEASES)** - Refers to the percentage of 30-year-old people who would die before their 70th birthday from any of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease.

* **Population, female (%) (PERCENT_FEMALE)** - The percentage of the population that is female.

* **Population living under the Poverty Line (%) (POVERTY)** - The percentage of the population living under the poverty line. Definition of poverty line varies per country. 

* **Unemployment, total (%) (UNEMPLOYMENT)** - Refers to the share of the labor force that is without work but available for and seeking employment.

* **Literacy rate, adult total (%) (LITERACY)** -The percentage of people ages 15 and above who can both read and write with understanding a short simple statement about their everyday life.

* **School enrollment, tertiary (%) (TERTIARY_ENROLLMENT)** - Gross enrollment ratio is the ratio of total enrollment, regardless of age, to the population of the age group that officially corresponds to tertiary level.

* **GDP per capita (current US$) (GDPPC)** - The gross domestic product divided by midyear population.

* **Population ages 15-64 (%) (WORKING_AGE)** - Total population between the ages 15 to 64 as a percentage of the total population.

* **Current health expenditure per capita (current US$) (HEALTH_EXPENDITURE)** - Current expenditures on health per capita in current US dollars.

* **Individuals using the Internet (%) (INTERNET_ACCESS)** - Internet users are individuals who have used the Internet (from any location) in the last 3 months. The Internet can be used via a computer, mobile phone, personal digital assistant, games machine, digital TV etc.

* **People using at least basic drinking water services (% of population) (%) (WATER_ACCESS)** - The percentage of people using at least basic water services. This indicator encompasses both people using basic water services as well as those using safely managed water services.

#### Principal Component Regression

Fig.3 Principal Component Regression (PCR)  

Since many of the independent variables above are highly correlated in nature, principal components will be derived from the original set of predictors. A subset of the principal components will be regressed with the dependent variable in order to obtain a final linear model. The following are the set of assumptions used in the analysis:

* All tests and variable selection processes uses **0.05** level of significance.
* The relationship between vulnerability and the predictor variables are **linear** and subject to random error.
* Error terms are assumed to be have a **mean of 0**, **normal**, **homoscedastic**, and **uncorrelated** unless there is a significant evidence to conclude otherwise. 

## Results and Discussion
#### Principal Component Analysis
* Principal Component Analysis were performed on all of the 13 independent variables. The correlation matrix instead of the covariance matrix was used to obtain the principal components. Using a cutoff of 80% in the cumulative percentage variance criterion, the first 5 PCs were retained.

The loadings of each PC with the original variables were computed. Each PC was labeled according to what independent variables they are strongly correlated to.

The retained PCs were labeled as follows:

* PC1 - Quality of Life (**QUALITY_LIFE_PC**)
* PC2 - Unemployment Rate (**UNEMP_PC**)
* PC3 - Percentage of female in the population (**PERCENT_FEMALE_PC**)
* PC4 - Exposure Index (**EXPOSURE_PC**)
* PC5 - Urban Population (**URBAN_PC**)

#### Multiple Linear regression

The new set of independent variables (retained PCs) were regressed with the dependent variable VULNERABILITY. Stepwise variable selection procedure was used.

Three significant PCs out of the five PCs were retained in the model. The model has an **R^2 value of 0.954**, indicating that the three remaining PCs can explain 95.4% of the variability in the vulnerability scores. The reason for this high number is that even though we only have 3 predictors left, **the principal components still contain most of the information from the original variables since each PC is a linear combination of all the independent variables**.

#### Diagnostic Checking
The assumptions of multiple linear regressions were checked. 

* LINEARITY - Based from the residual plots, there are no signs of nonlinearity and other irregularities aside from possible outlying observations. 

<img src="https://edwardnataniel.github.io/images/projects/7/resid.PNG" alt="drawing" width="400" />

* NORMALITY - There are also no signs of departures from normality since all the tests for normality fail to reject the null hypothesis of normality of the error terms.

<img src="https://edwardnataniel.github.io/images/projects/7/normal.PNG" alt="drawing" width="300" />

* HOMOSCEDASTICITY - The assumption of homoscedasticity was also not rejected.

<img src="https://edwardnataniel.github.io/images/projects/7/hetero.PNG" alt="drawing" width="200" />

* MULTICOLLINEARITY - The VIF values and Condition Indices are all 1. This is expected since correlation matrix was used to obtain the principal components and since all the principal components are uncorrelated with each other.

<img src="https://edwardnataniel.github.io/images/projects/7/vif.PNG" alt="drawing" width="500" />

* OUTLIERS - Five observations were tagged as possible outliers using the **cook’s distance** cutoff of 4/n = 4/168 = 0.024. But since refitting the model without these observations will yield almost the same results, the observations were not dropped. 

#### Final model

The final linear model is given by:

## Conclusion
The final model given above is a parsimonious model that can be used to explain the vulnerability score of a country. **Three principal components** were retained in the model. They are all significant and has an R^2 value of **0.954**. 

The first significant principal component is labeled as the **quality of living in the country**. It is correlated with 7 of the original indicators and will possibly decrease the vulnerability score when there is low mortality due to common diseases, low percentage of the population living under the poverty line, high literacy rate, high tertiary enrollment, high GDP per capita, high health expenditure per capita, high percentage of internet users, high percentage of population ages 15-64, and high percentage of people with access to at least basic drinking water services.

The second significant principal component is the **percentage of females in the population**. Females tend to be more educated, altruistic, and charitable than men so a higher female population can boost the morale of the disaster-stricken communities. 

The third significant principal component is the **urban population**. Weak infrastractures, lack of rescuers and rescue equipment, and limited space for evacuation are some of the possible reasons why an increase in urban population tends to also increase the vulnerability score.
