Hello.

I'm Edward. I'm currently a graduate student at University of the Philippines Diliman taking up MS Statistics. I have a bachelors degree in Computer Science from the same university. I have 3 years of professional experience in software development prior to graduate school.

My current interests are Machine Learning, Statistical Data Analysis, and Software Development. I do photography during my spare time. Check out my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/edward.nataniel/) account.
